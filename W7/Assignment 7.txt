Two items I neglected in class on Monday:
- If you are using Git, there is no need to end your filenames with the date, since doing so is a sort of cheap approach to versioning but Git provides a serious approach to versioning.
- I neglected to mention how to delete a repository. Simply delete it on GitHub and then delete the corresponding directory on your local computer.


MSDS 597 Assignment
Week 7: 


Homework to hand in (due October November 7, 7am):
Please be sure that your Rmarkdown file has yourself as author and has 
    output: html_document


Read the post at http://ellisp.github.io/blog/2016/10/29/538-pollsters
Read the article at http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/01/upshot/many-ways-to-map-election-results.html
Continue thinking about your course project: you want a topic that interests you and that has multiple sources of data

For the following problem, please create a GitHub repository. Submit the assignment by pasting, into the Sakai submission window, the GitHub url to clone your repo. That is all you will submit
- Download the csv file on maternal mortality at
    http://apps.who.int/gho/athena/data/xmart.csv?target=GHO/MDG_0000000025,MDG_0000000026&profile=crosstable&filter=COUNTRY:*;YEAR:*&x-sideaxis=COUNTRY;YEAR&x-topaxis=GHO
and store it in a data directory in your project repo. (You can read about the data  at http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.SDG31v?lang=en )
- Although the data is tidy, it needs cleaning. Notice that spaces are used instead of commas in numbers. Turn the numbers for maternal mortality inside square brackets into two new variables, lower_bound and upper_bound
- Download the gross national income data from http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.GNI107?lang=en (Download the complete data as a "CVS table", storing it in the data folder).
- Tidy this data, so that there is one entry per country per year
- Merge the two files by country and year, retaining only rows for which you have per capita income and either maternal mortality or percentage attended births


- Make a two polished  and informative graphs, one relating income to maternal mortality and the other relating income to percentage attended births
- Save a csv file with the merged, cleaned, and tidy data, using a suitable name of your choosing in the data folder.


- Use the country_choropleth() function in the choroplethr package to make a world map of maternal mortality, using the most recent year for each country in the merged dataset you created. The defaults of the function will be fine; no need to tune up the plot. You can read the help file to see how the data must be formatted; you may need to rename the countries from the dataset that you've created.
- All of your steps, other than downloading the files, should be contained in a single R Markdown file that will run in the repo directory. Be sure to describe your steps

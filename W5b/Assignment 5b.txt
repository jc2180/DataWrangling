Homework to hand in (due October 24, 7am):
Please submit a Rmarkdown file that runs on its own.

Finally, please be sure that your Rmarkdown file has yourself as author and has

3) Consider the following three websites,
    Medal count from Rio Olympics
        http://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/2016-rio-olympics-medal-tracker/
    Three letter contry codes:
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOC_country_codes
        (Note: I originally posted the page http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm , but that has ISO codes, not IOC codes)
    Populations of countries:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)
a) Please create a dataset with variables equal to the country name, the UN continental region, the population (2016), and the number of gold, silver, bronze, and total medals from the Rio Olympics. 
b) Grouping by region, please fit a linear regression of total medals on population and create a small dataset with only the variables of region and the R^2 from the regression.
c) Create a long (or tall) version of the dataset in (a) with a variable indicating the type of medal and a variable showing the number of medals for the country of that type.

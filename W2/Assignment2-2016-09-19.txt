MSDS 597 Assignment
Week 2: 
Read Boehmke 79--84, 100-108; 224--231; Read Kaplan Chapters 5, 6, & 8 (don't worry about
using Kaplan's non-ggplot2 graphics commands.
Do the Problems at the end of Kaplan Chapters 6 & 8 (don't hand in). 
You'll need to install the mosaicData package.


Homework to hand in (due 7 am on Monday):
 Please submit a Rmarkdown file that runs on its own (you can assume 
that "gapminder_2007_gini.tsv" is in the directory that RStudio is running from). 
Be sure to include explanatory text of what you are doing---don't just show a lot of 
R code and results. Use commands from the tidyverse, including pipes, when you can.

Please use the following file name convention: 
    Buyske_week_02.Rmd 
(changing the last name and the week as appropriate, of course).



In the following, please consider data frame and tibble to be interchangeable. 
If you want to see all of a tibble, you can do so using 
    print(example.tbl, width = Inf, n = Inf)




(1) Create a data frame from the dataset 
    https://nycopendata.socrata.com/api/views/xx67-kt59/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD
which is in csv format. 
Form a new data frame restricted to restaurants in Brooklyn with cuisine equal to 
"Ice Cream, Gelato, Yogurt, Ices". 
What are the 5 most common names (use the variable "DBA") in the data frame? 
(Restaurants are repeatedly inspected, so this is not the same as the most common names of restaurants.) 
What grades has Brooklyn ice cream store "SWEET EXPRESSIONS" received and how often? 
(Use the table command)

Note: you might find it a bit easier if you execute
    names(restaurant) <- make.names(names(restaurant))
(where restaurant is the name of the data frame)



(2) The file "gapminder_2007_gini.tsv" is in the class Dropbox folder; it is a subset of 
the 2007 Gapminder data merged with recent Gini coefficient data 
( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient ). Please make an interesting plot.
Please also generate a data frame showing, for each continent, the minimum, maximum, 
and average Gini coefficient.



(3) Using the original gapminder data frame, please generate a data frame with a new 
variable called gdp by multipling the population size by the gdp per capita. 
To make those large numbers more understandable, please form an additional new variable 
called gdp_ratio equal to the gdp divided by the gdp of the United States in 2007.
Find the mean gdp_ratio by continent and year, and then plot the mean gdp_ratio 
over time, distinguishing the continents. Please use both points and lines for the plot.
